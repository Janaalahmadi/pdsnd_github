BikeShare Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes bike sharing data from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The data includes information about the duration of bike trips, the stations where the trips start and end, and some demographic information about the riders.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need the following libraries: pandas, numpy, and datetime.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the bike sharing data files for each city: [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Washington, D.C.](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).
3. Place the data files in the `data` folder of the cloned repository.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
5. Run the `bikeshare.py` script using the command `python bikeshare.py`.
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program and explore the bike sharing data.
